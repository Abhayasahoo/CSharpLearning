First Time
----------

First Created a repositoy in Github after logging into Github using the reachabhaya account. ConsoleApplication_Abhaya with solution and project was already there under C:\Users\axs5965\Desktop\DevProjects\C# Learning. Created documents folder with documentation on key C# concepts and added the documentation file Basics of C#.docx. Also added a Readme.md file.

Used command line to get to the Directory C:\Users\axs5965\Desktop\DevProjects\C# Learning. Issue the below:
git init (it creates a .git folder).
git add . 
 (The above added the solution and all files and the documentation docs to the local git)
git commit -m "first commit"      (commits to local git but not yet uploaded to GIT WEB)
git remote add origin https://github.com/Abhayasahoo/CSharpLearning.git

           (maps the local GIT to GIT Web)
git push -u origin master
           (pushes the local files to Git Web)

Check the files in Git web to make sure everything is transferred.


Subsequent times
-----------------

Go to the local folder which has code and contents to be pushed to the Git repository

e.g. cd "C:\users\axs5965\desktop\devprojects"
     cd "C# Learning"


Make a change to a file or add new files

git status

git add .

git commit -m "message"
